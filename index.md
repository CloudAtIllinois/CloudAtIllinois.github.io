Welcome to the Cloud At Illinois Github project. This site is meant to gather information on Cloud projects at the University of Illinois involving Cloud technology.  We're just getting started and are in the early stages, but our hope is that this github organization will be able to provide a central place of information for projects at the University of Illinois as well as serve as a host for repositories. 

To see our repositories, visit the [CloudAtIllinois Github Organizatino](https://github.com/CloudAtIllinois)

Want to help out or contribute code? Please fill out our [membership request form](https://forms.illinois.edu/sec/485553031).
